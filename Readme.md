# fa-py (Felipe Almeida python scripts)

This repository has been turned into an installable python package in order to facilitate the distribution of my custom python scripts and, in turn, make them easier to execute.

## Installation

Installation is super easy and perhaps not required:

```bash
# Download
git clone https://github.com/fmalmeida/pythonScripts.git
cd pythonScripts

# Run without installing
python3 fa-py-runner.py -h

# Install and run in any place
python3 setup.py install
fa-py -h
```
