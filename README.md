This repository has been turned into an installable python package in order to facilitate the distribution of my custom python scripts and, in turn, make them easier to execute.

## Installation

Installation is super easy and perhaps not required:

```bash
# Download
git clone https://github.com/fmalmeida/pythonScripts.git
cd pythonScripts

# Run without installing
python3 fa-py-runner.py -h

# Or install with pip and run anywhere
pip install git+git://github.com/fmalmeida/pythonScripts.git
fa-py -h
```

## Old scripts

All my python scripts as single scripts, that may or may not be included in the package are available in the `bkp` folder!
